            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
              Here's a little about me. I love software engineering particularly
              the backend. I got into this out of pure curiosity and ended up
              being completely engrossed by it. I don't have much going on
              outside of development. I love reading non-fiction books, just
              recently started learning to draw. In my downtime, I play video
              games or watch anime. My current favorite TV show is Attack On
              Titan. I'm horrible at singing. I currently work as a contract
              backend developer at{" "}

              and finishing my degree in BSC. Mathematics with computing at

          <h2>About this blog</h2>
          <p>
            I strive to be a better developer every day. Some of the recommended
            ways to achieve this are by teaching and journaling progress. This
            blog is meant to serve this purpose by acting as a platform for me
            to track and measure my progress as I learn and for you to learn
            various software engineering topics with real-world examples. We
            will discuss algorithms & data structures, system design &
            architecture, databases, DevOps, and tackle emerging technologies.
            Join me in this journey, and let us learn together ðŸ™‚.
