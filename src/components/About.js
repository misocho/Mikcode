            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
              Here's a little about me. I love software engineering with a focus
              on the backend. I got into this out of pure curiosity and ended up
              being completely engrossed by it. I don't have much going on
              outside of development. I love reading non-fiction books, recently
              started learning to draw. In my downtime, I play video games or
              watch anime. My current favorite TV show is Attack On Titan. I'm
              horrible at singing. I currently work as a contract backend
              developer at{" "}

          <h2>About this blog</h2>
          <p>
            I strive to be a better developer every day. Some of the recommended
            ways to achieve this are by teaching and journaling progress. This
            blog is meant to serve this purpose by acting as a platform for me
            to track and measure my progress as I learn and for you to learn
            various software engineering topics with real-world examples. We
            will discuss algorithms & data structures, system design &
            architecture, databases, APIs & Microservices, DevOps, and tackle
            emerging technologies. Join me in this journey, and let us learn
            together ðŸ™‚.
